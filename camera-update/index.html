      <h2>How to update Sony's Smart Remote Control</h2>
    </header>
    <p class="intro">
    Some Sony cameras require a software update to allow for exposure and focus controls. This document
    describes the easiest and most reliable way to update camera software. It
    unlocks all Shutter features.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>You'll need around 20 min, your camera charged to at least 60%, and a Wi-Fi network.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Step 1. Create an account with Sony</h3>
    <p>We recommend doing this step at a computer, tablet or smartphone.
    You could do it in camera but having a real keyboard helps a lot.</p>

    <p>To start, create an account with
    <a href=" http://account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/">Sony Entertainment Network</a>.
    We have a few tips here:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Make sure you select a region that matches your current location.
        Otherwise, you might be unable to log in.</li>
      <li>Pick an easy password. You'll need to enter it in camera. You can change it to something more secure after
        the upgrade.</li>
      <li>Sony will send you an email. Make sure to follow the confirmation link from that email.
        <strong>Skip 2 factor authentication and phone number verification.</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2. Update Smart Remote Control</h3>
    <p>Once your account is created and activated, you may proceed to
    the update process. Make sure your camera is well charged (at least
    60%) and your Sony account has 2 factor authentication disabled.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Make sure your camera's time and region are correct. Otherwise you won't be able to connect to Sony website. To set time in camera:
        "Menu" &rarr; toolbox icon (the last one) &rarr; Area and time &rarr; set accordingly</li>
      <li>Go back to the main menu &rarr; 4th tab with little squares &rarr; "Application List"</li>
      <li>Select "PlayMemories Camera Apps"</li>
      <li>
        Connect to your home Wi-Fi
        <ol>
          <li>Click "Network Settings"</li>
          <li>"Access Point Set."</li>
          <li>Select your Wi-Fi name</li>
          <li>Enter password and click "OK"</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Once connected to the Wi-Fi network, you should see the "PlayMemories Camera Apps" website with "Smart Remote Control" and "Update" buttons.
        Click on the "Update".</li>
      <li>Click "Update" again</li>
      <li>You should be presented with a question: "You must have a Sony account. Do you have one?". Choose "Yes".</li>
      <li>Enter the login and password that you've created earlier.</li>
      <li>Click "Agree and continue".</li>
      <li>Start the update process. It should last about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
