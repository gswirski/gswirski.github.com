    <h1>How to update Sony's Smart Remote Control</h1>
    <p class="intro">
    Some Sony cameras require an update to allow for exposure and focus controls. This document
    describes the easiest and most reliable way to update the camera software
    and unlock all Shutter features.</p>
    <p>You'll need around 20 min, your camera charged to at least 60%, and a Wi-Fi network.</p>

    <h2>Step 1. Create an account with Sony</h2>
    <p>We recommend doing this step at a computer, tablet or smartphone.
    You could do it in camera but it's much faster this way.</p>

    <p>To start, create an account with
    <a href=" http://account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/">Sony Entertainment Network</a>.
    We have a few tips here:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Make sure you select a region that matches your current location.
        Otherwise, you might be unable to log in.</li>
      <li>Pick an easy password. You'll need to enter it in camera. You can change it to something more secure after
        the upgrade.</li>
      <li>Sony will send you an email. Make sure to follow the confirmation link from that email.
        <strong>Skip 2 factor authentication and phone number verification.</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 2. Update Smart Remote Control</h2>
    <p>Once your account is created and activated, you may proceed to
    the update process. Make sure your camera is well charged (at least
    60%) and your Sony account has disabled 2 factor authentication.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Make sure your camera time and region are correct. Otherwise you won't be able to connect to Sony website. To set time in camera:
        "Menu" &rarr; toolbox icon (the last one) &rarr; find area and time &rarr; set accordingly</li>
      <li>Go back to the main menu &rarr; 4th tab with little squares &rarr; "Application List"</li>
      <li>Select "PlayMemories Camera Apps"</li>
      <li>
        Connect to your home Wi-Fi
        <ol>
          <li>Click "Network Settings"</li>
          <li>"Access Point Set."</li>
          <li>Select your Wi-Fi name</li>
          <li>Enter password and click "OK"</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Once connected to the Wi-Fi network, you should see the "PlayMemories Camera Apps" website with "Smart Remote Control" and "Update" buttons.
        Click on the "Update".</li>
      <li>Click "Update" again</li>
      <li>You should be presented with a qustion: "You must have a Sony account. Do you have one?". Choose "Yes".</li>
      <li>Enter the login and password that you've created earlier.</li>
      <li>Click "Agree and continue".</li>
      <li>Start the update process. It should last about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
